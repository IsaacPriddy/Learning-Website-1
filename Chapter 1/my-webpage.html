INFO
    -If you put keywords into you h1 tag, it ends up being more discoverable by

    -For more tags Google "html formatting"
    -Pulling an image via address link is known as HOT LINKING, and is generally
        frowned upon by web devs as you are creating traffic on their end and taking
        their image. Just put it on your own server.
    -Google html entites to find the specific "escape characters" for each tag/attribute/thing
        -useful for when you need certain symbols or things not on an american keyboard
    -For video the best format is mp4 since it has the most widespread support by browsers
