                This website is built so that I can test my development skills when it comes to building a website. 
                There will be navigation to test pages in which I try different things such as a web browser game
                or maybe some API scraping, but there will also be a page that links to my different github projects
                that I am actively working on, or have worked on in the past along with explanations.
