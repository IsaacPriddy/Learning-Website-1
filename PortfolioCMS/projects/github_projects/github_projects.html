        <p>
            This page has links and images associated with some of my current github projects, as well as links to the associated project.
            The idea being, this is a nice place to show off some of the projects, their current progress, and how they are supposed to work.
            Maybe down the line I will even add additional functionality so that the projects can be demoed on the website page itself.
